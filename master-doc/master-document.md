Definition of Done: Being able to demo the product during production. It also validates that the product meets the customer's standards via communication with the product owner.
Capstone Definition of Done: Each story must be deployed to production & demo-able by 10:59pm on the Sunday at the end of each sprint.
"Done" stories should ensure existing logic is still working correctly.
